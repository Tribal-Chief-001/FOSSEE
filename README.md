## Overview

This repository contains the **final submission** for **FOSSEE Python Screening Task 2**. The task requires designing a **pedagogically robust AI prompt** that:

- Analyzes a studentâ€™s buggy Python code  
- Offers constructive suggestions and hints  
- Avoids revealing the correct solution  
- Adapts to learner skill levels: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced  

This project includes:

- **Markdown prompt** for human readability  
- **JSON prompt** for machine integration  
- **10-page white paper PDF** detailing the design, pedagogy, and reasoning

## Prompt Details

### Role of AI

The AI acts as a **mentor and guide**, providing reflective hints, diagnostics, and conceptual nudges **without giving direct solutions**. The goal is to **enhance learning while preserving learner autonomy**.

### Operating Principles

- Supportive, encouraging, and non-judgmental tone  
- Avoid providing full code solutions  
- Encourage experimentation and small tests (print statements, test cases)  
- Adapt suggestions according to skill level  

### Structured Response Framework

The AI follows a **six-step framework**:

1. **Goal Identification** â†’ Verify program intent and objectives  
2. **Bug Triage** â†’ Classify error types (syntax, logic, recursion, etc.)  
3. **Guided Checks** â†’ Suggest small diagnostic experiments  
4. **Conceptual Nudges** â†’ Highlight relevant Python concepts  
5. **Probing Questions** â†’ Ask reflective questions  
6. **Next Steps** â†’ Recommend iterative investigation strategies  

### Skill-Level Adaptation

| Skill Level   | Guidance Strategy                                           |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Beginner      | Stepwise hints, concrete examples, incremental reasoning |
| Intermediate  | Guided testing, conceptual nudges, reflective questions  |
| Advanced      | Edge-case exploration, abstract reasoning, strategy tips |

### Dual-Format Implementation

- **Markdown:** Human-readable and review-friendly  
- **JSON:** Structured for AI system integration or automated pipelines

## White Paper

A **10-page PDF** accompanies this repository, covering:

- Prompt design methodology and rationale  
- Pedagogical principles for AI-assisted debugging  
- Beginner, intermediate, and advanced examples  
- Challenges in prompt engineering  
- Ethical considerations  
- References and appendices (Markdown & JSON prompts)  

---

## Usage Instructions

- **Markdown Prompt:** Open `AI_Debugging_Prompt.md` to read and review the prompt.  
- **JSON Prompt:** Use `AI_Debugging_Prompt.json` in AI systems for integration.  
- **White Paper:** Open `WhitePaper.pdf` for detailed design rationale, examples, and evaluation metrics.  

This repository is designed for **educational submission purposes**, demonstrating advanced prompt engineering and AI-assisted pedagogy in Python debugging.

---

## Design Rationale (Summary)

- **Clarity:** Structured guidance ensures precise, pedagogically sound AI responses.  
- **Non-Solution-Oriented:** Guardrails prevent AI from giving solutions; learners remain active participants.  
- **Adaptable:** Tailors prompts to different skill levels.  
- **Dual Format:** Markdown + JSON maximizes usability for both humans and systems.  
- **Pedagogical Alignment:** Six-step framework encourages reflective, iterative problem-solving aligned with educational principles.  


âœ¨ **This submission is comprehensive, structured, and designed to maximize pedagogical impact while aligning with FOSSEE Task 2 guidelines.**
